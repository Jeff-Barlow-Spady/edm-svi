st.markdown(
"""
In this project, I embarked on a statistical journey to create a comprehensive scoring system for neighborhood evaluation. 
Through the application of factor analysis, machine learning optimization, and meticulous visual data exploration,
I developed a model that not only accurately assesses neighborhood characteristics but also provides a statistically sound benchmark for comparison. 
This report encapsulates the detailed analytical processes and presents the project's impactful outcomes.

- **Histograms**: Both unweighted and weighted scores appear to be approximately normally distributed,
with a single peak around the mean.
- **Boxplots**: The boxplots show that the unweighted scores have a wider range and higher median compared to the weighted scores. 
There are no obvious outliers in either distribution, which suggests that scores are relatively evenly distributed across neighbourhoods.
- **Scatter Plot**: The scatter plot of weighted vs. unweighted scores indicates a positive relationship between the two,
 as would be expected since they are based on the same data

- The distributions of scores are roughly symmetric, and the presence of a single peak suggests that most neighbourhoods cluster around the mean score.
- The quartile information shows that the data is evenly split across the quartile ranges.
- The positive correlation between unweighted and weighted scores indicates consistency in scoring across the two methods.
