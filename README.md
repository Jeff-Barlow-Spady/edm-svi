**⚠️ Important Notice**

This project was created for learning purposes and is my first project. I'm proud of what I learned and believe it has great potential. However, it requires further work, including drill-downs and the ability to explore the factors driving experiences of vulnerability.

This project needs a storytelling component to help explain the data and the factors driving the score. I'm also working on a way to make the map interactive and allow users to drill down into the data.
